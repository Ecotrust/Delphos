multi-criteria analysis (MCA).  It is cross-platform and able to run on
Linux, Mac OSX and Windows.

Development Requirements
============

Open Delphos is known to work with Python 4.2.3 and later

Python Modules required:
  - QT 4.2
  - PyQT
  - SIP
  - SQLAlchemy 0.2 (API changes in 0.3 means you cannot use anything later than 0.2 currently)
  - SQLite (Already built into Python 2.5)
  - Matplotlib

Running Open Delphos from source:
  - Run make from the src directory to build all of the PyQT interfaces.  mingw32-make works well on Windows.  This will compile all of the user interfaces 
  - Run make release_translate to compile a new release of the spanish translation
  - Run Delphos.py (#python Delphos.py)

Building Delphos into a standalone application

  Additional packages needed for compiling a standalone Delphos executable:
  - py2app (Max OS X)
  - py2exe (Windows)
  - InnoSetup Installer (Windows)
    
  Mac OSX
  >python macsetup.py py2app
  - app will be in the dist directory
  
  Windows
  >python winsetup.py py2exe (just executable)
  >python win_inno_setup.py py2exe (executable + installer)
  - executable will be in the dist directory
  - installer will be in the dist\Output directory
  - The installer script that's generated will automatically copy in all of the necessary documentation and data files.  If you just generate the executable you will need to manually copy the db and data directories into the dist directory.
