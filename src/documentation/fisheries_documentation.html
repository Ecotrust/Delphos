<h1>Introduction</h1>
<a href="#fisheries_background">Background</a>
<p>
Decisions regarding conservation problems are complex because they deal with interactions among people, their livelihoods, and natural resources.  Moreover, decisions may involve controversial or poorly understood issues such as the status of species, equity, or property rights. Selecting a fishery that has the right set of characteristics to be successful in the <a href='http://www.msc.org'>Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)</a> certification program may be even more complex.  
</p>
<p>
Delphos: Fisheries is a decision-making tool for selecting suitable candidate fisheries for MSC certification.  It can be used to evaluate fisheries anywhere in the world and in any size region.  This program will guide you through a data-gathering and analysis process that is compatible with your institutional and project goals.

<a name='background'><h1>Background</h1></a>
<p>
Through the application of an environmental standard for sustainable and well-managed fisheries, the MSC seeks to harness consumer purchasing power to generate change and promote environmentally responsible stewardship of the world's fisheries.  MSC certification not only provides long-term security for fishing communities and the marine environment, but also offers fisheries an opportunity to improve their management and advocate for better data collection, new laws, and stronger enforcement measures.
</p>
<p>
The MSC is a standard-setting organization that has, with expert scientists from around the world, developed certification criteria for well-managed and sustainable fisheries.  Each fishery that applies for MSC certification is evaluated by the assessment team with regard to a standard set of principles and criteria concerning 1) the health of the target species, 2) the effects of the fishery on the ecosystem, and 3) the quality of the management system.  For details about the MSC standard, please see www.msc.org.
</p>
<p>
Early critics of the MSC contended that the certification process was geared toward large-scale, industrial fisheries, and inaccessible to small-scale community fisheries due to extensive data requirements and prohibitive costs.  However, many small-scale fisheries are healthy and well-managed.  Small-scale fisheries are also of enormous global importance, as small-scale fishers comprise approximately 94% of the world's fishers and produce nearly half of the global fish supply for human consumption.  Small-scale fisheries provide most of the protein and jobs for coastal communities around the world and operate in some of the most biologically rich and diverse places on earth.  
</p>
<p>
WWF's <a href='http://www.panda.org/marine/community_fisheries'>Community Fisheries Program</a> helps small-scale fisheries through the MSC certification process.  WWF has been working on small-scale fisheries certification since 1999, emphasizing the participation of local fishers and the importance of traditional knowledge in the certification process, and thereby engaging communities in protecting the resources they rely upon.
</p>
<h2>Program History</h2>
<p>
In the spring of 2000, <a href='http://www.cobi.org.mx'>Comunidad y Biodiversidad A.C. (COBI)</a>, in partnership with the WWF Community Fisheries Program, wondered how to select the best candidate for MSC certification from dozens of fisheries on the Baja California peninsula.  This software program is based on the pre-analysis process that COBI and the Community Fisheries Program conducted to select a suitable community fishery for certification.  
</p>
<p>
Because we needed to confront different institutional objectives from various project partners, we designed a method to systematize our decision-making process.  By convening an expert panel to gather data and using a multicriteria analysis process, we selected the <a href='http://www.panda.org/news_facts/newsroom/news/index.cfm?uNewsID=12799&uLangID=1'>Baja California red spiny lobster</a>, Panulirus interruptus, as our preferred MSC candidate fishery.  In April 2004, this fishery became the first small-scale fishery from a developing country to receive MSC certification.   
</p>
<p>
Due to the success of this pilot project, COBI and the WWF Community Fisheries Program have developed this versatile software program for selecting suitable candidates for MSC certification.  
</p>

<a name='multicriteria_analysis_evamix'><h1>Multicriteria Analysis/Evamix</h1></a>

<p>
Multicriteria analysis is a versatile tool for evaluating environmental and conservation questions.  We selected multicriteria analysis as the appropriate decision-making tool to select candidates for MSC certification because it can handle both qualitative and quantitative criteria and allows a question to be evaluated from different points of view.  
</p>
<p>
Multicriteria analysis allows the inclusion of both qualitative and quantitative information because it does not require converting all data involved in the assessment to the same unit.  This flexibility allows one to include very vague criteria, such as the “community’s current interest in MSC certification,” as well as hard data, such as “catch volume.”  
</p>
<p>
Institutional or program goals may be expressed by weighting—or giving importance to—certain criteria.  The data can then be analyzed multiple times from the perspectives of various project partners.  For example, one partner may wish to work with a fishery in a community that is actively involved in the management system, while another partner finds it more important that the fishery has strong national and international markets.  Using multicriteria analysis, partners may assign importance to each criterion as determined by their individual goals, and the fisheries can be evaluated from each point of view.  The results from each analysis provide the basis for discussion among project partners about which fishery to select for the MSC certification process.
</p>
<p>
The multicriteria approach used in Delphos is the Evamix method, a matrix-based evaluation and ranking tool.  The Evamix algorithm results in a relative ranking of each fishery that incorporates all of the criteria and criteria weights.  Evamix is an ideal tool for our purposes of analyzing and comparing fisheries because it is simple and flexible, and allows the user to clearly define both qualitative and quantitative evaluation criteria.

<p>
The following pages will step you through the pre-analysis process: project planning, information gathering, and the use of the multicriteria analysis program, Delphos.  Each link in the chain depends, to an extent, on the one before.  As such, it is important to think through the entire process before jumping into the project.  Brainstorming the outcome of each step in advance will help ensure that you gain the most from each step.  
</p>
<p>
The pre-analysis is meant to give you a better understanding of the fisheries that exist in a given geographical area and whether or not they are good candidates for MSC certification.  This method is not meant to reveal larger political or cultural issues related to fisheries.  While you can learn about some of these issues through discussions with local experts, it is imperative to be aware of the political realities of the region in question before you begin and incorporate them into your project goals and design.

<a name='1_define_your_goals'><h2>1. Define Your Goals</h2></a>
<p>
There are a number of reasons why an organization might want to explore MSC certification for fisheries in a given region.  Alternatively, a group might want to use the pre-analysis process not with MSC certification in mind, but simply to create a database of information related to fisheries in a given region.
</p>
<p>
Your reasons for using this program will impact the way you approach the pre-analysis process, from how you define the geographic region to the weights you apply to criteria.  Having a clear understanding from the beginning of what you seek to accomplish will make the entire process flow more smoothly and produce more meaningful and applicable results.
</p>

<a name='2_define_your_timeline'><h2>2. Define Your Timeline</h2></a>
<p>
It is important to consider the timeline for your project as part of your initial brainstorming and project design.  In addition to considering your intended outcome, it is helpful to think about how much time you want to spend on each step of the process.  Defining a timeline will help you avoid taking on too much.  
</p>
<p>
For example, if you want to see results within one year, it would be unwise to look at a very large region that includes a lot of fisheries.  On the other hand, if you are interested in a large region, it is important to realize that your timeline may be closer to two years.  In addition to the time needed to run the pre-analysis, you might also want to consider the time needed to complete goals beyond this point, such as MSC assessment or certification of the selected fishery.  Depending on the size and complexity of the fishery, the actual certification process can become quite lengthy.  Thinking through this step will help refine expectations.
</p>

<a name='3_define_the_region'><h2>3. Define the Region</h2></a>
<p>
This model can be used anywhere in the world and in any size region.  However, the selection and definition of a region is a critical part of both the pre-analysis and MSC certification.  It is important to keep in mind that the certification process can often be long and challenging.  While conducting a pre-analysis can help avoid some of the obstacles associated with this kind of work, trying to tackle too large a region will create additional difficulties.  It is critical that the realities of your financial and human resources agree with the realities of the region that you choose to work in.  
</p>
<p>
If you are considering a very large region, it is beneficial to compartmentalize the project.  You could do this based on management components, as may be the case in a multi-state country, or by biological components, such as habitats.  By dividing the region in this way, you will essentially be dealing with a number of mini-projects as opposed to one very large project.  Alternatively, consider partnering with other organizations throughout the region that can locally execute the following chain of steps.
</p>
<p>
In addition to considerations of size, it is important to consider your reasons for deciding to work in a given area.  If conservation of an area is your main purpose and MSC certification is only one element of the conservation plan, then biological importance may be your driving force for site selection.  While this makes sense for conservation purposes, good fishery candidates that do not lie directly in an area of biological importance can easily be overlooked.  If fisheries sustainability or sustainable resource development is your driving force, then it might be beneficial to consider a larger area.  The importance of working in a biologically important location can still be considered down the line as part of the criteria for selecting a candidate fishery, and can be weighted accordingly.  This approach will safeguard against limiting your options from the beginning.  
</p>

<a name='identify_experts'><h2>4. Identify Experts</h2></a>
<p>
Now that you have done some planning and set the goals and geographical boundaries of your project, it is time to start looking for candidate fisheries.  There may be hundreds of active fisheries in your selected region.  In addition, these fisheries can likely be described by a broad range of characteristics, ranging from coastal to oceanic, artisanal to industrial, and community-based to government-managed.  So, how do you narrow the field?  How do you start to determine which fisheries meet the goals of your project? 
</p>
<p>
Don’t try to do it alone!
</p>
<p>
The first step is to identify a panel of experts that can help provide fisheries information and guidance.  The panel should be composed of a wide range of experts, giving you the most comprehensive picture of fisheries in your area.  You might include several types of experts: academics, research scientists, fishery managers, government officials, staff of non-profits or NGOs, fishers, and others that work in the fishing industry.  You can add additional types of experts if you feel their knowledge and opinions will add to the process.  The inclusion of a variety of experts can also help you spread the word about the MSC and your organization’s goals in the region—a bit of additional outreach that will help the process run more smoothly later on.  
</p>
<p>
Also consider the culture of the region you are working in when deciding on your approach to data-gathering and the types of experts to include in your panel.  Working in some locations may require creative tactics to obtain the cooperation of various stakeholders.
