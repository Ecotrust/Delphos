<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
Decisions regarding conservation problems are complex because they deal with interactions among people, their livelihoods, and natural resources.  Moreover, decisions may involve controversial or poorly understood issues such as the status of species, equity, or property rights. Selecting a fishery that has the right set of characteristics to be successful in the <a href='http://www.msc.org'>Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)</a> certification program may be even more complex.  
</p>
<p>
Delphos: Fisheries is a decision-making tool for selecting suitable candidate fisheries for MSC certification.  It can be used to evaluate fisheries anywhere in the world and in any size region.  This program will guide you through a data-gathering and analysis process that is compatible with your institutional and project goals.
</p>

<a name='background'><h1>Background</h1></a>
<p>
Through the application of an environmental standard for sustainable and well-managed fisheries, the MSC seeks to harness consumer purchasing power to generate change and promote environmentally responsible stewardship of the world's fisheries.  MSC certification not only provides long-term security for fishing communities and the marine environment, but also offers fisheries an opportunity to improve their management and advocate for better data collection, new laws, and stronger enforcement measures.
</p>
<p>
The MSC is a standard-setting organization that has, with expert scientists from around the world, developed certification criteria for well-managed and sustainable fisheries.  Each fishery that applies for MSC certification is evaluated by the assessment team with regard to a standard set of principles and criteria concerning 1) the health of the target species, 2) the effects of the fishery on the ecosystem, and 3) the quality of the management system.  For details about the MSC standard, please see www.msc.org.
</p>
<p>
Early critics of the MSC contended that the certification process was geared toward large-scale, industrial fisheries, and inaccessible to small-scale community fisheries due to extensive data requirements and prohibitive costs.  However, many small-scale fisheries are healthy and well-managed.  Small-scale fisheries are also of enormous global importance, as small-scale fishers comprise approximately 94% of the world's fishers and produce nearly half of the global fish supply for human consumption.  Small-scale fisheries provide most of the protein and jobs for coastal communities around the world and operate in some of the most biologically rich and diverse places on earth.  
</p>
<p>
WWF's <a href='http://www.panda.org/marine/community_fisheries'>Community Fisheries Program</a> helps small-scale fisheries through the MSC certification process.  WWF has been working on small-scale fisheries certification since 1999, emphasizing the participation of local fishers and the importance of traditional knowledge in the certification process, and thereby engaging communities in protecting the resources they rely upon.
</p>
<h2>Program History</h2>
<p>
In the spring of 2000, <a href='http://www.cobi.org.mx'>Comunidad y Biodiversidad A.C. (COBI)</a>, in partnership with the WWF Community Fisheries Program, wondered how to select the best candidate for MSC certification from dozens of fisheries on the Baja California peninsula.  This software program is based on the pre-analysis process that COBI and the Community Fisheries Program conducted to select a suitable community fishery for certification.  
</p>
<p>
Because we needed to confront different institutional objectives from various project partners, we designed a method to systematize our decision-making process.  By convening an expert panel to gather data and using a multicriteria analysis process, we selected the <a href='http://www.panda.org/news_facts/newsroom/news/index.cfm?uNewsID=12799&uLangID=1'>Baja California red spiny lobster</a>, Panulirus interruptus, as our preferred MSC candidate fishery.  In April 2004, this fishery became the first small-scale fishery from a developing country to receive MSC certification.   
</p>
<p>
Due to the success of this pilot project, COBI and the WWF Community Fisheries Program have developed this versatile software program for selecting suitable candidates for MSC certification.  
</p>

<a name='multicriteria_analysis_evamix'><h1>Multicriteria Analysis/Evamix</h1></a>

<p>
Multicriteria analysis is a versatile tool for evaluating environmental and conservation questions.  We selected multicriteria analysis as the appropriate decision-making tool to select candidates for MSC certification because it can handle both qualitative and quantitative criteria and allows a question to be evaluated from different points of view.  
</p>
<p>
Multicriteria analysis allows the inclusion of both qualitative and quantitative information because it does not require converting all data involved in the assessment to the same unit.  This flexibility allows one to include very vague criteria, such as the "community's current interest in MSC certification,” as well as hard data, such as "catch volume.”  
</p>
<p>
Institutional or program goals may be expressed by weighting-or giving importance to-certain criteria.  The data can then be analyzed multiple times from the perspectives of various project partners.  For example, one partner may wish to work with a fishery in a community that is actively involved in the management system, while another partner finds it more important that the fishery has strong national and international markets.  Using multicriteria analysis, partners may assign importance to each criterion as determined by their individual goals, and the fisheries can be evaluated from each point of view.  The results from each analysis provide the basis for discussion among project partners about which fishery to select for the MSC certification process.
</p>
<p>
The multicriteria approach used in Delphos is the Evamix method, a matrix-based evaluation and ranking tool.  The Evamix algorithm results in a relative ranking of each fishery that incorporates all of the criteria and criteria weights.  Evamix is an ideal tool for our purposes of analyzing and comparing fisheries because it is simple and flexible, and allows the user to clearly define both qualitative and quantitative evaluation criteria.

<p>
The following pages will step you through the pre-analysis process: project planning, information gathering, and the use of the multicriteria analysis program, Delphos.  Each link in the chain depends, to an extent, on the one before.  As such, it is important to think through the entire process before jumping into the project.  Brainstorming the outcome of each step in advance will help ensure that you gain the most from each step.  
</p>
<p>
The pre-analysis is meant to give you a better understanding of the fisheries that exist in a given geographical area and whether or not they are good candidates for MSC certification.  This method is not meant to reveal larger political or cultural issues related to fisheries.  While you can learn about some of these issues through discussions with local experts, it is imperative to be aware of the political realities of the region in question before you begin and incorporate them into your project goals and design.

</p>

<a name='1_define_your_goals'><h2>1. Define Your Goals</h2></a>
<p>
There are a number of reasons why an organization might want to explore MSC certification for fisheries in a given region.  Alternatively, a group might want to use the pre-analysis process not with MSC certification in mind, but simply to create a database of information related to fisheries in a given region.
</p>
<p>
Your reasons for using this program will impact the way you approach the pre-analysis process, from how you define the geographic region to the weights you apply to criteria.  Having a clear understanding from the beginning of what you seek to accomplish will make the entire process flow more smoothly and produce more meaningful and applicable results.
</p>

<a name='2_define_your_timeline'><h2>2. Define Your Timeline</h2></a>
<p>
It is important to consider the timeline for your project as part of your initial brainstorming and project design.  In addition to considering your intended outcome, it is helpful to think about how much time you want to spend on each step of the process.  Defining a timeline will help you avoid taking on too much.  
</p>
<p>
For example, if you want to see results within one year, it would be unwise to look at a very large region that includes a lot of fisheries.  On the other hand, if you are interested in a large region, it is important to realize that your timeline may be closer to two years.  In addition to the time needed to run the pre-analysis, you might also want to consider the time needed to complete goals beyond this point, such as MSC assessment or certification of the selected fishery.  Depending on the size and complexity of the fishery, the actual certification process can become quite lengthy.  Thinking through this step will help refine expectations.
</p>

<a name='3_define_the_region'><h2>3. Define the Region</h2></a>
<p>
This model can be used anywhere in the world and in any size region.  However, the selection and definition of a region is a critical part of both the pre-analysis and MSC certification.  It is important to keep in mind that the certification process can often be long and challenging.  While conducting a pre-analysis can help avoid some of the obstacles associated with this kind of work, trying to tackle too large a region will create additional difficulties.  It is critical that the realities of your financial and human resources agree with the realities of the region that you choose to work in.  
</p>
<p>
If you are considering a very large region, it is beneficial to compartmentalize the project.  You could do this based on management components, as may be the case in a multi-state country, or by biological components, such as habitats.  By dividing the region in this way, you will essentially be dealing with a number of mini-projects as opposed to one very large project.  Alternatively, consider partnering with other organizations throughout the region that can locally execute the following chain of steps.
</p>
<p>
In addition to considerations of size, it is important to consider your reasons for deciding to work in a given area.  If conservation of an area is your main purpose and MSC certification is only one element of the conservation plan, then biological importance may be your driving force for site selection.  While this makes sense for conservation purposes, good fishery candidates that do not lie directly in an area of biological importance can easily be overlooked.  If fisheries sustainability or sustainable resource development is your driving force, then it might be beneficial to consider a larger area.  The importance of working in a biologically important location can still be considered down the line as part of the criteria for selecting a candidate fishery, and can be weighted accordingly.  This approach will safeguard against limiting your options from the beginning.  
</p>

<a name='4_identify_experts'><h2>4. Identify Experts</h2></a>
<p>
Now that you have done some planning and set the goals and geographical boundaries of your project, it is time to start looking for candidate fisheries.  There may be hundreds of active fisheries in your selected region.  In addition, these fisheries can likely be described by a broad range of characteristics, ranging from coastal to oceanic, artisanal to industrial, and community-based to government-managed.  So, how do you narrow the field?  How do you start to determine which fisheries meet the goals of your project? 
</p>
<p>
Don't try to do it alone!
</p>
<p>
The first step is to identify a panel of experts that can help provide fisheries information and guidance.  The panel should be composed of a wide range of experts, giving you the most comprehensive picture of fisheries in your area.  You might include several types of experts: academics, research scientists, fishery managers, government officials, staff of non-profits or NGOs, fishers, and others that work in the fishing industry.  You can add additional types of experts if you feel their knowledge and opinions will add to the process.  The inclusion of a variety of experts can also help you spread the word about the MSC and your organization's goals in the region-a bit of additional outreach that will help the process run more smoothly later on.  
</p>
<p>
Also consider the culture of the region you are working in when deciding on your approach to data-gathering and the types of experts to include in your panel.  Working in some locations may require creative tactics to obtain the cooperation of various stakeholders.  
</p>
<p>
<a href='qrc:/doc/fisheries_examples_from_the_field.doc'>Click here</a> for a comparison of how the WWF Community Fisheries Program outlined the first four steps in the pre-analysis process in three very different scenarios.  
</p>

<a name='5_consult_the_experts'><h2>5. Consult the Experts</h2></a>
Once you have identified your panel of experts, you are ready to start asking for advice.  It is important that the experts are well informed about the MSC certification process and the goals of your institution.  Informing participants is critical to obtaining the best information about fisheries in your region.  

<h3><a name='pre-analysis_workshop'>Pre-Analysis Workshop</a></h3>
<p>
Because the concept of ecolabeling and the MSC process are complex and often best explained in person, the most effective way to educate your panel is to bring them together at a workshop where you present your project goals and the MSC program.  This provides a framework with which you can discuss appropriate candidate fisheries.  
</p>

<h3><a name='the_questionnaire'>The Questionnaire</a></h3>
<p>
Once you have well-informed experts, we recommend asking them to complete a questionnaire as a way to gather information about potential candidate fisheries.  You can have the experts fill out questionnaires as individuals or in groups at or after the workshop.  
</p>
<p>
If a workshop is logistically or financially unfeasible, you can write a <a href='qrc:/doc/fisheries_letter_to_experts.doc'>letter to the experts</a> asking for their help.  Be sure to provide the experts with a list of sources of information (e.g. websites) where they can learn more about the MSC and your organization.  Also, remember that the experts might be very busy.  If you do not receive a response from them, follow up by phone or e-mail, and perhaps ask for an appointment to interview them personally.
</p>
<p>
Three example questionnaires are provided.  First is our <a href='qrc:/doc/fisheries_general_questionnaire.doc'>general</a> questionnaire.  This questionnaire is very thorough, and we suggest that you adapt it to your region and specific goals.  For example, although the majority of the questionnaire remained similar, the WWF Community Fisheries Program modified several questions to reflect a <a href='qrc:/doc/fisheries_data_driven_questionnaire.doc'>data-driven</a> culture in one region and <a href='qrc:/doc/fisheries_data_limited_questionnaire.doc'>data-limited</a> conditions in another.  
</p>

<a name='6_review_recommendations'><h1>Review Recommendations</h1></a>

<p>
Once the experts have returned completed questionnaires, you should complete a <a href='qrc:/doc/fisheries_profile.doc'>fishery profile</a> for each of your candidates.  The profile is a way to compile all of the information that you have collected into a comprehensive overview of each fishery.  Feel free to modify our example to capture the information you have gathered with your questionnaires.  You will use the fishery profiles later on to evaluate your criteria in the software program.  
</p>
<p>
It is extremely important that you enter accurate data into the software program, especially for quantitative criteria, as the information will affect your results.  Therefore, we strongly recommend that you ground truth the information you have collected.  You might also need to seek out supplementary information that was not provided.  You could do this by meeting with potential candidates to review the facts about their fishery and gage their interest in MSC certification.  Since MSC certification is voluntary and requires the participation of the fishery, it is essential that your chosen candidate is interested in engaging in the process.  You could also consult other stakeholders, published literature, or reliable online references such as <a href='http://www.fishbase.org'>FishBase</a>.
</p>
<p>
After you have completed the fishery profiles and verified the information received, you should review the experts' recommendations and determine if the suggested fisheries fit with your institutional and project goals.  Discuss the candidates with your project partners.  At this point, you may want to remove one or more of the fisheries from consideration.  However, if you would like to end with a database of all of the information you have gathered, we suggest narrowing the field of candidates at a later point in the process.
</p>

<h1><a name='7_design_your_database'>7. Design Your Database</a></h1>

<p>
Now that you have selected and gathered sufficient information about your candidate fisheries, it is time to begin your analysis.  
</p>
<p>
Click <a href='qrc:/app/create_project'>here</a> to create a new project and design your database.
</p>

<h2><a name='define_alternatives'>Define Alternatives</a></h2>

<p>
Alternatives are fisheries.  A default set of alternatives can be loaded during project creation, otherwise you will be presented with an empty alternative table.  Use the "add" and "remove" buttons to populate and edit the list of alternatives to use in your analysis.  Once you are finished move on by selecting the "criteria" tab.
</p>

<h2><a name='define_criteria'>Define Criteria</a></h2>

<p>
Criteria are specific standards that the software program will use to evaluate the candidate fisheries from biological, management, political, socioeconomic, and market perspectives.  Criteria may reflect qualitative or quantitative information.  Qualitative criteria are assessed on an ordinal scale, which must be clearly defined.
</p>
<p>
Over the course of a number of projects, we have developed a list of suggested <a href='qrc:/doc/fisheries_criteria_and_guidance.doc'>criteria and guidance</a> for their evaluation, which are built into the program.  This list reflects lessons we have learned and covers the most important areas to consider when selecting a successful small-scale fishery to guide through the MSC certification process.  However, feel free to add, delete, or modify the criteria based on your specific project goals and location.  Also, keep in mind that you are not required to use all of the criteria in your analysis-use this stage as a way to create a complete database of all of the information you have collected.
</p>
<p>
After you have made any changes using the "add" and "remove" buttons, click "proceed" to display your criteria down the first column of your database. 
</p>

<h1><a name='8_run_analysis'>8. Run Analysis</a></h1>

<p>
Once you have defined your alternatives and critera you can perform multicriteria analysis (MCA).  To do this, select the "Run Analysis" tab within your project window.  The analysis dialog allows you to view previous analysis runs and begin new ones.  To begin a new analysis run enter a name and description for this run in the appropriate field and select the "Start Analysis" button.
</p>

<h2><a name='select_alternatives'>Select Alternatives</a></h2>

<p>
At this point you will have a good sense of which fisheries to include in the evaluation process.  Select the fisheries you want to evaluate by clicking the appropriate checkboxes in the first column of the table.  We recommend selecting no less than 3 fisheries.  You must use the same list of criteria for all fisheries under comparison.  
</p>

<p>
Select the "Next" button to move on to the next step (Selecting Criteria)
</p>

<h2><a name='select_criteria'>Select Criteria</a></h2>

<p>
Select the criteria you want to evaluate by clicking the appropriate checkboxes in the first column of the table.  We recommend keeping the upper limit to between 10-15 alternatives.
</p>

<p>
You will likely find that you lack enough information to complete every cell.  However, it is essential that you evaluate all of the selected criteria for each fishery that you want to compare, as the program cannot evaluate fisheries with gaps in information.  
</p>

<p>
To fill these gaps you will want to consult your panel of experts again.  By relying on the experts for information, you ensure a robust evaluation.  You may want to invite them to a workshop aimed at filling information gaps, where you divide them into small groups and ask the groups to assess each fishery against each criterion.  This will facilitate discussion, creating a better flow of information and resulting in a more complete data set.  If you are unable to have a workshop and must send the experts the evaluation table, you will need to average their opinions when the tables are returned.  You could also again consult other stakeholders, published literature, or reliable online references such as <a href='http://www.fishbase.org'>FishBase</a>.  If you still cannot address some of the criteria, then those criteria with data gaps must be dropped from the analysis.
</p>

<p>
Select the "Next" button to move on to the next step (Inputting data)
</p>

<h2><a name='input_data'>Input Data</a></h2>

<p>
A table is shown where the fisheries you selected form the columns and the criteria you selected form the rows.  When you click on cells associated with qualitative criteria, the responses that are built into the program (or, if you added criteria, that you previously defined) are displayed.  Using your completed fishery profiles, select the appropriate response for each fishery.  You will need to manually enter quantitative information.
</p>

<p>
Select the "Next" button to move on to the next step (Weighting Criteria)
</p>

<h2><a name='weight_criteria'>Weight Criteria</a></h2>

<p>
Once the evaluation table is complete and you are satisfied with the robustness of the information, you are ready to weight the criteria.  As we discussed at the beginning, different partners in the project may have different goals.  Weighting the criteria allows project partners to decide which criteria are most important given their differing viewpoints.  
</p>

<p>
For example, say you are planning a vacation, and have narrowed your potential destinations to Mexico, Alaska, and Italy.  Your choice will differ depending on the importance of various criteria such as weather, activities, and cost.  If you dream of lying on a warm, sandy beach, you would prefer Mexico or Italy over Alaska.  If cost is then important, and visiting Mexico would be less expensive than traveling to Italy, you might choose to go to Mexico.  If cost is not as important to you as the availability of local wines, you would prefer Italy.  On the other hand, if weather is not important to you and you really want to see wildlife, you might pick Alaska.  Your decision will vary based on how much weight you place on your criteria, just as in this program.
</p>

<p>
Criteria must be weighted on an ordinal scale of 1-5, where 1 is very important and 5 is not at all important.  Keep in mind that criteria weights have a large impact on the final result.
</p>

<p>
You may first want to have each partner weight the criteria independently.  This will provide a basis for discussion.  You can also run the model using an average of each partner's weights, as well as equal weights for all criteria.
</p>

<p>
Select the "Next" button to move on to the next step (Running the Analysis)
</p>

<h2><a name='run_the_program'>Run the Program</a></h2>

<p>
At this point you are ready to run the model.  Select the "Run Analysis" button.  Once completed a summar of the result will be shown.
</p>

<p>
You can run the model multiple times with differently weighted criteria, and thus evaluate the fisheries based on the different scenarios, goals, and viewpoints of your project partners.  The ability for multiple analyses also allows you to compare different groups of fisheries.  For example, if you have fisheries from different countries in your dataset, you might want to compare fisheries in one country at a time.  In this case, you might run the program a number of times using differently weighted criteria for each of your groups of fisheries.
</p>

<h1><a name='evaluating_your_results'>Evaluating Your Results</a></h1>

<p>
Each evaluation will produce a ranking of the fisheries you have analyzed, which you may visualize graphically.  At this point you will want to bring the project partners together to discuss any differences in rankings, what might be causing the changes, and how to best select your top candidate to enter the MSC assessment process.  
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind that the quality of your results is only as good as the quality of your data, and that the rankings are based on pairwise comparisons.  Thus, your highest-ranked fishery is not necessarily certain to meet all of the MSC Principles and Criteria.
</p>

<p>
Analysis runs are stored in your project database and can be viewed from the "Analysis" tab in the project window.  Simply select a run from the "previous analysis" table and select the "View analysis results" button.  Multiple results can be opened at one time and viewed alongside one another allowing you to review the different rankings with your partners and select the best candidate for MSC certification.
</p>

<h1><a name='next_steps'>Next Steps</a></h1>

<p>
You have by this time built a support system of partners, colleagues, and stakeholders who helped you with this evaluation process.  They would very much appreciate a report on your experiences as well as your final decision, with which you may want to include a note thanking them for their help.  
</p>

<p>
You will also want to communicate your selection back to the stakeholders of the fishery you selected, as they will be excited to hear about the results of your analysis.  Once you have re-confirmed the fishery's interest, contact the WWF Community Fisheries Program and/or the MSC for assistance entering the pre-assessment process.
</p>

<h1><a name='conclusion'>Conclusion</a></h1>

<p>
Delphos is a step-by-step process designed to help you select a good community-based fishery candidate for MSC certification.  As with any method, you should modify it to suit your needs.  If you have any suggestions or feedback on either the pre-analysis method or the software program, please do not hesitate to contact us-your advice is more than welcome.
