<h1>Introduction</h1>
<a href="#fisheries_background">Background</a>
<p>
Decisions regarding conservation problems are complex because they deal with interactions among people, their livelihoods, and natural resources.  Moreover, decisions may involve controversial or poorly understood issues such as the status of species, equity, or property rights. Selecting a fishery that has the right set of characteristics to be successful in the <a href='http://www.msc.org'>Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)</a> certification program may be even more complex.  
</p>
<p>
Delphos: Fisheries is a decision-making tool for selecting suitable candidate fisheries for MSC certification.  It can be used to evaluate fisheries anywhere in the world and in any size region.  This program will guide you through a data-gathering and analysis process that is compatible with your institutional and project goals.

<a name='fisheries_background'><h1>Background</h1></a>
<p>
Through the application of an environmental standard for sustainable and well-managed fisheries, the MSC seeks to harness consumer purchasing power to generate change and promote environmentally responsible stewardship of the world's fisheries.  MSC certification not only provides long-term security for fishing communities and the marine environment, but also offers fisheries an opportunity to improve their management and advocate for better data collection, new laws, and stronger enforcement measures.
</p>
<p>
The MSC is a standard-setting organization that has, with expert scientists from around the world, developed certification criteria for well-managed and sustainable fisheries.  Each fishery that applies for MSC certification is evaluated by the assessment team with regard to a standard set of principles and criteria concerning 1) the health of the target species, 2) the effects of the fishery on the ecosystem, and 3) the quality of the management system.  For details about the MSC standard, please see www.msc.org.
</p>
<p>
Early critics of the MSC contended that the certification process was geared toward large-scale, industrial fisheries, and inaccessible to small-scale community fisheries due to extensive data requirements and prohibitive costs.  However, many small-scale fisheries are healthy and well-managed.  Small-scale fisheries are also of enormous global importance, as small-scale fishers comprise approximately 94% of the world's fishers and produce nearly half of the global fish supply for human consumption.  Small-scale fisheries provide most of the protein and jobs for coastal communities around the world and operate in some of the most biologically rich and diverse places on earth.  
</p>
<p>
WWF's <a href='http://www.panda.org/marine/community_fisheries'>Community Fisheries Program</a> helps small-scale fisheries through the MSC certification process.  WWF has been working on small-scale fisheries certification since 1999, emphasizing the participation of local fishers and the importance of traditional knowledge in the certification process, and thereby engaging communities in protecting the resources they rely upon.

<h2>Program History</h2>
<p>
In the spring of 2000, <a href='http://www.cobi.org.mx'>Comunidad y Biodiversidad A.C. (COBI)</a>, in partnership with the WWF Community Fisheries Program, wondered how to select the best candidate for MSC certification from dozens of fisheries on the Baja California peninsula.  This software program is based on the pre-analysis process that COBI and the Community Fisheries Program conducted to select a suitable community fishery for certification.  
</p>
<p>
Because we needed to confront different institutional objectives from various project partners, we designed a method to systematize our decision-making process.  By convening an expert panel to gather data and using a multicriteria analysis process, we selected the <a href='http://www.panda.org/news_facts/newsroom/news/index.cfm?uNewsID=12799&uLangID=1'>Baja California red spiny lobster</a>, Panulirus interruptus, as our preferred MSC candidate fishery.  In April 2004, this fishery became the first small-scale fishery from a developing country to receive MSC certification.   
</p>
<p>
Due to the success of this pilot project, COBI and the WWF Community Fisheries Program have developed this versatile software program for selecting suitable candidates for MSC certification.
